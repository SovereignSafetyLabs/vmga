# VMGA Roadmap

VMGA's roadmap focuses on reducing operator friction while preserving the
approval, signing, evidence, and deployment-boundary constraints that make the
control meaningful.

This document describes direction and boundaries, not a delivery commitment. It
is intentionally high-level and slow-changing. For the current state of work,
see the GitHub issues, milestones, and `CHANGELOG.md`; those are the living
record. This file exists to explain where VMGA is headed and, just as
importantly, where it will not go.

## Principle

Make the safe path easier to operate, while preserving the inconvenient parts
that are the security boundary.

Some friction in VMGA is load-bearing. A human approving out of band, a signing
key the broker never holds, evidence the agent cannot rewrite, and credentials
the agent cannot read are not rough edges to smooth away; they are the control.
Roadmap work reduces cognitive friction for operators. It does not reduce the
separation between an agent's reasoning and its authority.

## Direction: Operator Experience Without Boundary Collapse

VMGA is intended to become easier to run without weakening what it enforces.
Planned directions include:

- Single-file deployment configuration and a guided start path, so standing up a
  broker does not require assembling many flags by hand.
- A consolidated read-only status view covering broker health, deployment
  posture, pending proposals, and evidence state.
- Proposal review ergonomics: summaries, diffs, and risk flags rendered from
  the canonical proposal so an operator can review faster.
- A local operator console that acts only as a client of the VMGA broker.
- Documented patterns to help operators achieve credential isolation and
  hardened deployments.
- Optional decoy (canary) tripwires that make a collapsed deployment boundary
  observable, surfacing a real direct-bypass attempt as evidence. Detection
  only: VMGA does not prevent a bypass, and a quiet canary is never treated as
  proof of isolation.

These are directions, not shipped features, and not capabilities VMGA provides
on its own today. Credential isolation, in particular, remains a deployment
precondition that an operator establishes; VMGA does not provide it by itself.

## Boundary Rules For Operator Tooling

Any operator-experience work is constrained by these rules:

- A console or UI is a broker client only. It never becomes a second write path
  to Gmail, Workspace, state, or evidence.
- Proposal review is advisory presentation derived from the canonical proposal.
  The operator approves the actual proposal, not a rendering of it; what is
  shown must match what is signed.
- Signature mode keeps approver private keys outside both the console and the
  broker authority domain.
- Status and review surfaces are read-only; observing state and changing state
  stay separate.
- Operator tooling surfaces the deployment's posture plainly, so an advisory
  deployment is never mistaken for a hard-enforcement one.
- Any remote or mobile surface is operator-managed and is not part of VMGA's
  default hard-enforcement claims.

## Anti-Goals

VMGA will not:

- Claim prompt-injection prevention, DLP, host compromise protection,
  browser/session isolation, compliance certification, or security of
  Hermes/OpenClaw internals.
- Add auto-approval, "remember my approval," or approve-all-from-sender
  behavior.
- Hold approver signing keys in the broker.
- Add a second write path to mailbox side effects that bypasses VMGA.
- Present itself as a hosted service or imply a deployment is hard-enforcing
  when its preconditions are not met.

Convenience stops where authority separation begins.
